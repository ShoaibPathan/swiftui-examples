/**
 This impl fixes the issue in Buggy1 by injecting child view's view store from parent view so its lifecycle maintains the same as parent view
 and won't be re-constructed every time.
 
 But another issue introduced here is storing child view's view store in parent view as `ObservedObject` - so parent view will get refreshed
 even when only child view's view store is updated - which shou;dn't alert parent view at all. This probably seems OK at first, but could introduce
 surprising behaviors if there are  side-effects conducted within `body` (eg. create subscription, network request, etc.)
 
 The fix is to change `ObservedObject` to a simple `let` for child view store in parent view, so that parent view won't be refreshed when
 child view store gets updated cause it isn't really observing it.
 
 Probably a general rule of thumb here is to always have a single `ObservedObject` per `View` ?
